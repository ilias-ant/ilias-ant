My life-long interests include:
- climbing  :climbing:
- literature & non-fiction reading :books: ([This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Seven_Killings) and also [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail) are two of my favourite books respectively <3)

Currently, i am - and will be for the best part of the year - focused on MLOps and time-series forecasting.

ML & software engineering blog posts i've written over time:

- [adversarial validation: can i trust my validation dataset?](https://ilias-ant.github.io/blog/adversarial-validation/)

Books i'm currently reading:
