Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

My name is **Ilias Antonopoulos** and i work as a Machine Learning Engineer in Athens, Greece.

I am also a graduate student of the [MSc in Data Science](https://datascience.aueb.gr/) @ Athens University of Economics and Business ([AUEB](https://www.aueb.gr/en)).

My work-related / scientific interests involve:
- machine-learning applications
- natural language processing (NLP)
- software engineering
- statistics
- open-source software

My life-long interests include:
- hiking :hiking_boot:
- literature & non-fiction reading :books: ([This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Seven_Killings) and also [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail) are two of my favourite books respectively <3)
- cooking :man_cook:
- travelling :airplane: 

Currently, i am - and will be for the best part of the year - focused on NLP and Deep Learning theory & applications. ðŸŒ±

If time permits, i would like to pick up a new programming language (Go or Rust?) around summer.
